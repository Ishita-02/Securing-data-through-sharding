ng Services" project in more detail: Project Concept The project involves building a decentralized platform that facilitates the rental of assets (e.g., bicycles, tools) using smart contracts on a blockchain. The platform will also incorporate AI to monitor the usage and condition of the rented items, ensuring a seamless and trustworthy renting experience.
Components and Functionality: User Registration and Profile Management: Users will create accounts on the platform and provide their information, including payment details and a digital wallet for transactions.
Asset Listings: Users can list their assets (e.g., bicycles, tools) available for rent. Each listing will include details about the asset, rental rates, availability, and terms.
Smart Contract Creation: When a user lists an asset, a smart contract is created. This contract outlines the terms of the rental agreement, including the rental duration, price, deposit, and conditions for returning the asset.
Rental Request and Approval: Renters can browse through the available assets, select the ones they want to rent, and submit a rental request. The smart contract will automatically validate the availability and terms. Once the owner approves the request, the smart contract will initiate the rental period.
AI Monitoring: AI algorithms will be integrated to monitor the usage and condition of the rented asset. This could involve sensors, images, or other data sources. For instance, AI might analyze sensor data from a rented bicycle to ensure it's being used properly and not experiencing any issues.
Usage and Condition Reports: The AI will generate usage and condition reports for the rented asset. These reports can be accessible to both the owner and the renter. If any anomalies or potential problems
