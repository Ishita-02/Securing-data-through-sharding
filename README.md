Securing data through Sharding  

Overview
This project focuses on enhancing data security through innovative sharding techniques. By combining user-friendly registration and login systems with robust encryption, sharding, and hashing mechanisms, the project ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and efficient retrieval of user data.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have Java installed. Detailed instructions for installation can be found in [link to installation documentation].

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/Ishita-02/Securing-data-through-sharding

Usage
This project provides a secure data storage and retrieval system with the following functionalities:

User Registration and Login
Users can register with secure authentication and log in to access the system. This ensures a safe entry point for personal data.

Data Input and Storage
Users can input personal details through a user-friendly interface, and the data is securely stored in the system.

File Encryption
The project employs the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm to ensure the confidentiality of stored information.

Sharding and Lookup Table
Encrypted data is divided into shards, and a lookup table is used to efficiently manage and retrieve these shards.

File Merger
The file merger algorithm reconstructs the original file seamlessly from its sharded components during data retrieval.

Decryption Algorithm
A secure decryption algorithm is applied to revert encrypted data to its original form.

Hashing and Ledger System
Data integrity is maintained through hashing, and a ledger system securely stores and manages file hashes.

Limitations and Future Enhancements
While the current implementation is successful, there are limitations to consider. Future enhancements may include exploring advanced encryption techniques, integrating distributed ledger technologies, and addressing scalability challenges.
